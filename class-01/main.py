# Python Practice Example Questions (Based on Your Code)

# 1. Create a variable to store an integer value and display it on the screen.

# student_age = 20
# print("Student age is", student_age)

# Create a variable to store your first name and print it.

# studentName:str = "Sadiq khan"
# print("student name is", studentName)

# Store your name and age in two separate variables, then display a message showing both together.
# myName:str = "sadiq khan"
# my_age:int = 25
# print("My name is", myName, "and my age is", my_age)


# Identify the three main Python data types (string, integer, float) and write one example for each.

# dataText:str = "sadiq khan"
# Num:str = 35
# roundNum:float = 5.77
# print("Data type of dataText is", type(dataText), "Data type of Num is", Num, "Data type of RoundNum is ", roundNum)

# Create a variable for your name, gender, and profession, then print all of them in one meaningful sentence.

# studentName:str = "Arsalan"
# studentAge:int = 17
# studentProfession:str = "Student"
# print("My name is", studentName, "and i'm", studentAge, "Years old", "and My profession is", studentProfession)

# Check and print the data type of a variable that stores your age.

# arsalanAge:int = 20

# Make a list of three fruits and print only the second fruit from that list.

# fruits = ["Banana", "Apple", "Cherry"]
# print("The second fruit in the list is", fruits[1])

# def greet():
#     print("Hello this my first python fuction")
    
# greet()

# Global Variable

course_name = "Web & App Development"
print(course_name)

def myFunction():
    # Local Variable
    course_duration = "3 Months"
    courseAgenda = "To understand fundamentals of Programming and Ai"
    print("Course Duration is", course_duration)
    
    
myFunction()

    
# print("i m tring to access the function variable here:", course_duration)  # This will raise an error because course_duration is not defined in this scope

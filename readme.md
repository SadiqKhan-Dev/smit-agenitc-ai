## 📘 Overview  

This repository contains all **classwork, assignments, and AI-driven mini-projects** developed during the **Saylani Modern Web & Agentic AI Development Program**.  

The goal of this repository is to document the **learning journey** — from Python fundamentals to advanced AI system development — and to showcase the practical implementation of **Agentic AI concepts** using real-world examples and projects.

Would you like me to **extend this README** by adding a section for **“Project Preview Images / GIFs”** (so that each Streamlit or AI app has a thumbnail and short caption)?  
That would make the repository visually engaging for instructors and visitors.
